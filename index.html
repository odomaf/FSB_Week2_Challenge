        <h2>about me</h2>
          <p>What are you up to? What are you making? How can I learn more? How can I help? What do you love? Want to see what I’ve been working on? How does your brain work? How do you solve problems? How can we get our differing brains working to solve problems humans need solved? 
          </p>
          <p>I bring my curiosity to the table for every team I join. Human-centered work environments encourage human-centered tech development, and we live in a time where tech can enhance inclusivity and ability in leaps and bounds. How can we build applications that take advantage of curiosity, are driven by compassion, and foster community? Do these values align with your team’s values? I want in.</p>
